# P2P-Lending
Our idea provides a solution to the glitches of SMEs( Small and Medium sized Enterprises) who struggle​ ​to​ raise​ ​ ​funds for ​ ​their​ day-to-day​ ​​business​ ​activities​ ​as​ commercial​ ​ banks​ ​prefer​ ​ to​ ​ ​give​ loans​ ​​to​ ​big​ business​ houses, even though SMEs have less chances to default. We leverage the latest technology of Blockchain to provide a transparent and quick sanctioning of loans for SMEs, abiding by all the regulations provided by RBI. ​This will lead to​ ​increase​ ​in​ ​business of SMEs and will​ ​ultimately result​ ​in the rise​ ​ of​ ​ contribution​ ​of ​ SMEs​ ​ ​towards GDP, ​ ​employment rate​ ​ ​and​ ​liquidity​ ​to​ ​the ​ ​banks,​ ​which ​ can​ ​ ​be ​ ​considered ​ ​an ​ important​ ​ ​factor to ​ shape​ ​ ​the economy​ ​ of​ ​ ​the​ ​nation​ ​in​ ​a better​ ​ ​way.​ ​
